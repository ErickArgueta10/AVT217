	<p> Martin Fletcher's website balances text and image very well in a creative way. He offers creative and visually icons that can easily explain what information is on his page. The color palette on this page is simple as well where it is mainly his brand colors and other secondary colors based on the job highlighted. Navigation is simple and takes you to a highlighted job where he shows off his UX knowledge.

	<p>
		Yaron Schoen's portfolio website is incredibly simple. His resume is structured as if he were having a conversation with you where you &quot;answer&quot; the question through a link. He then ends the conversation with one sentence with various links to certain words that link to his work and contact info. His color palette is based on two colors where his brand color is the same as his link color. This is an interesting concept for a portfolio.

	<p>
		Maarten Hoogvliet caught my eye immediately through his strong use of his brand color. In fact, that seems to be his main color palette for all of his pages. Each page that showcases a specific job is well-organized and balanced with his images. He mainly sticks with a manuscript grid for his work. However, his Contact pages is split between two columns for easy readability.

<h1><a href="https://ivomynttinen.com/">Ivo Mynttiten</a></h1>
	<p>
		Mynttiten's website is both interactive and clean. The home page immediately gives this site a professional look. The navigation is easy to use and even offers a nice transition sequence when transferring to a new page. The color palette is mainly limited to white and black but the designer uses a highly-saturated blue in some places to give it more attention.

	<p>
		David Blum's portfolio webpage is highly visual. He highly relies on his brand color palette for the basis of webpage. The dark background allows his images to really pop. Besides the landing page, his work and images are oranzized in a modular manner. His navigation method is concise where he uses the &quot;hamburger&quot; icon to hide the navigation so his pages have alot of white spaces which adds to visual appeal.
