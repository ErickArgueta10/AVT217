This portfolio website will include a place to display all of my portfolio pieces and should include at least 10 works with descriptions and my resume. This is site will display an HTML version of my resume as well as a downloadable PDF. There should also be clear navigation throughout.The pictures should be high quality and saved in a format that would reduce large file sizes. Good typography and composition choices should be incorporated into the website. Lastly, the portfolio should include my contact information. The entire website should be in HTML form.</p>
